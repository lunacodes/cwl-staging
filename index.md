The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations to cluster, cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments. CWL is designed to meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Astronomy, High Energy Physics, and Machine Learning.

CWL is developed by a multi-vendor working group consisting of organizations and individuals aiming to enable scientists to share data analysis workflows. [The CWL project is maintained on Github](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) and we follow the [Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development](https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/). Legally CWL is a member project of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2018/apr/11/cwl-new-member-project/) and is formally managed by the elected [CWL leadership team]({{ site.url }}/#Leadership_Team), however every-day project decisions are made by the [CWL community]({{ site.url }}/#Support) which is open for participation by anyone.
